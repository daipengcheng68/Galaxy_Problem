Description:
    I found the third problem is the most interesting problem.
    I used node.js to solve this challenge.

    So, please install dependencies with command "npm install"


dependencies I used:
    jest


I have used bash for command line tool.
To excute the test file run the below command:
    npm test

    (INFO: to run jest in package.json add in "scripts" the following:
    "scripts": {
        "test": "jest"
    })

Please excute the tool run the below command:
    node woody.js


Here's the example:

    PS E:\problem_DaiPengcheng> node woody.js
    Please input the condition or Question in the "input.txt" line by line
